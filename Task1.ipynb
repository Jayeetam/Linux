    "##  Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: It is an open-source operating system which is freely available to everyone.\n",
    "Unix: It is an operating system which can be only used by its copyrighters.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Examples\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: It has different distros like Ubuntu, Redhat, Fedora, etc\n",
    "Unix: IBM AIX, HP-UX and Sun Solaris.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Users\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Nowadays, Linux is in great demand. Anyone can use Linux whether a home user, developer or a student.\n",
    "Unix: It was developed mainly for servers, workstations and mainframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux is used everywhere from servers, PC, smartphones, tablets to mainframes and supercomputers.\n",
    "Unix: It is used in servers, workstations and PCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux is freely distributed,downloaded, and distributed through magazines also. And priced distros of Linux are also cheaper than Windows.\n",
    "Unix: Unix copyright vendors decide different costs for their respective Unix Operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: As it is open source, it is developed by sharing and collaboration of codes by world-wide developers.\n",
    "Unix: Unix was developed by AT&T Labs, various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Manufacturer\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux kernel is developed by the community of developers from different parts of the world. Although the father of Linux, Linus Torvalds oversees things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: Unix has three distributions IBM AIX, HP-UX and Sun Solaris. Apple also uses Unix to make OSX operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  GUI\n",
    "Linux: Linux is command based but some distros provide GUI based Linux. Gnome and KDE are mostly used GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: Initially it was command based OS, but later Common Desktop Environment was created. Most Unix distributions use Gnome.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Interface\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: The default interface is BASH (Bourne Again SHell). But some distros have developed their own interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: It originally used Bourne shell. But is also compatible with other GUIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  File system support\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux supports more file system than Unix.\n",
    "Unix: It also supports file system but lesser than Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux is a Unix clone,behaves like Unix but doesn't contain its code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: Unix contain a completely different coding developed by AT&T Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: Linux is just the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: Unix is a complete package of Operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: It provides higher security. Linux has about 60-100 viruses listed till date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: Unix is also highly secured. It has about 85-120 viruses listed till date\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Error detection and solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux: As Linux is open-source,whenever a user post any kind of threat, developers from all over the world start working on it. And hence, it provides faster solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix: In Unix, users have to wait for some time for the problem to be resolved."

    "A computer has a sufficient amount of physical memory but most of the time we need more so we swap some memory on disk. Swap space is a space on a hard disk that is a substitute for physical memory. It is used as virtual memory which contains process memory images. Whenever our computer runs short of physical memory it uses its virtual memory and stores information in memory on disk. Swap space helps the computer’s operating system in pretending that it has more RAM than it actually has. It is also called a swap file. This interchange of data between virtual memory and real memory is called swapping and space on disk as “swap space”. \n",

If you don’t want to use virtual memory you can easily disable it all together but in case if you run out of memory then the kernel will kill some of the processes in order to create a sufficient amount of space in physical memory. So it totally depends upon the user whether he wants to use swap space or not."
