There’s the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system), the GNU shell utilities (the terminal interface and many of the commands you use), the X server (which produces a graphical desktop), the desktop environment (which runs on the X server to provide a graphical desktop), and more. System services, graphical programs, terminal commands – many are developed independently from another. They’re all open-source software distributed in source code form.\n",

However, compiling the software would take a lot of time – not to mention the work involved with making all the different programs work properly together.\n",

Most distributions add their own finishing touches, such as themes and custom software – the Unity desktop environment Ubuntu provides, for example.\n",
