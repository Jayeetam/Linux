When a user wants to switch to a different mod, they simply switch the branch, and then any launcher or script that they have in place to launch their copy of DF will now run on top of the other branch."

The path that's ultimately specified to the filesystem by the JVM may be affected by the locale, and on Linux with common filesystems, for example, often produces UTF-8 paths.

    "In Git, all branches are simply tags or pointers. Unlike other source control systems, Git doesn’t create copies of files to track changes. Instead, Git tracks all changes as a directed acyclic graph where each node is a set of changes made at one time. Any such node can be a branch, which allows changes to diverge from other parts of the tree. A merge simply modifies the Git object graph without any file-system impacts as in other source control systems. As such, branches in Git are very lightweight to create and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Common types of branches\n",
    "+ Trunk branch\n",
    "Every Git repository has a trunk (also referred to as main, mainline, or the master branch). When a Git repository is created, the trunk exists automatically as the implicit first branch. The use of a trunk and the timing of changes landing on it vary depending on the exact branching strategy being used. In trunk-based development, the trunk is the central branch to which all developers send their code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Development branch\n",
    "The development branch is a long-lived feature branch that holds changes made by developers before they’re ready to go to production. It parallels the trunk and is never removed. Some teams have the development branch correspond with a non-production environment. As such, commits to the development branch trigger test environment deployments. Development and trunk are frequently bidirectionally integrated, and it’s typical for a team member to bear the responsibility of integrating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Feature branch\n",
    "A feature branch can be short- or long-lived depending on the specific branching flow. The branch often is used by a single developer for only their changes, but it is possible to share it with other developers as well. Again, the branching strategy will determine how exactly you define a “feature branch”. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Release branch\n",
    "A release branch can be either short-lived or long-lived depending on the strategy. In either case, the release branch reflects a set of changes that are intended to go through the production release process.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Hotfix branch\n",
    "A hotfix branch is a branch that’s used generally to hold changes related to emergency bug fixes. They can be short-lived or long-lived, though generally they exist as long-lived branches split off from a release branch. They tend to be more common in teams with explicitly versioned products, such as installed applications."
